### Tips to make it GitHub-ready

1. **Add images** for diagrams inside a folder like `docs/images` and link them in README.
2. Include `requirements.txt` for Python dependencies.
3. Add `.gitignore` for Python projects (`venv/`, `__pycache__/`, etc.).
4. Add MIT license or other license file.

I can also **create a fully completed README with placeholders filled, badges, and visuals included**, ready to copy-paste into GitHub.

Do you want me to do that?
